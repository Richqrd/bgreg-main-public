Kirkby, L. A., Luongo, F. J., Lee, M. B., Nahum, M., Van Vleet, T. M., Rao, V. R., Sohal, V. S. (2018). An amygdala-hippocampus subnetwork that encodes variation in human mood. Cell, 175(6), 1688-1700.

We use it to compute the Intrinsic Coherence Network object, which is a network identification process based on computing the independent components from the coherence-based correlation metrices.
