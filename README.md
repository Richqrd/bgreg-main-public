# bgreg: brain graph representations generator

This project proposes a framework for creating network and graph representations from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. It includes an explainability module to generate and process Learnable Importance MEtric (LIME) scores.

An overview of the pipeline functionality has been published in Díaz-Montiel AA, Zhang R, Lankarany M. Optimal graph representations and neural networks for multichannel time series data in seizure phase classification. Scientific Reports. 2025 Jun 4;15(1):19552. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-01882-7
