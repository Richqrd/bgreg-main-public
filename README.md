# bgreg: brain graph representations generator

This project proposes a framework for creating network and graph representations from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.

An overview of the pipeline functionality has been published in Díaz-Montiel, Alan A., and Milad Lankarany. "Graph representations of iEEG data for seizure detection with graph neural networks." bioRxiv (2023): 2023-06. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.02.543277v1
