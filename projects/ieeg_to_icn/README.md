(_intracranial electroencephalography to intrinsic coherence networks_)

This project provides a framework for creating cross-regional brain subnetwork (CRBS) representations in the form of intrinsic coherence networks (ICN [1]) from intracranial electroncephalography (iEEG) signals data.

It operates as a pipeline for:
- reading BIDS-iEEG data files [2].
- processing iEEG signals (i.e., segmentation, filtering).
- computing measurements of co-activity of the iEEG signals.
- computing CRBS representations: representing iEEG signals as graphs.
- visualizing iEEG signals, measurements of co-activity, and CRBS representations.

# Walkthrough

Here we showcase an example on 
- how to set up the directory tree structure for one project, 
- how to read a BIDS-iEEG patient record, how to use the functions in ```pipeline.py``` to read and process the data, compute the measurements of co-activity, compute the CRBS representations, and
- how to visualize the data . 

Any and all parts of the code are intended to serve as templates from where you can build upon.

### To get started

First, you must create the directory tree where _data_-related files will be stored. By default, all the data-related files will be stored under the ```~/ieeg_to_crbs/data``` directory. This directory is automatically created upon importing ```native/datapaths.py```. Check the ```native/README.md``` file fore more information on datapaths.


### The dataset
For this walkthrough, we use the data of the first run from pt6 in dataset from https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003029/versions/1.0.3. You ought to download at least one patient dataset to continue with the execution of the pipeline. You can simply download from the link or use our API (```~/ieeg_to_crbs/projects/download_dataset.py```, or ```~/ieeg_to_crbs/utils/dataproc/ds003029_download.py```)

This is a dataset of human subjects with epilepsy that underwent epileptogenic-zone resective surgery. 
These are BIDS iEEG recordings that span 2-3min per record. 
The dataset contains information on the clinically identified epileptogenic zone for each patient.
Here we will create CRBS representations marking the epileptogenic-zone in the diagrams.

### Running the pipeline

```main.py```  is a template for executing the pipeline for one patient.

```$ PYTHONPATH=. python3 projects/ieeg_to_icn/main.py```

Note: The epileptogenic (or seizure onset) zone of pt6, and from all the patients, can be found in the Excel sheet found in the repository ```data/sourcedata/clinical_data_summary.xlsx```.

Example of coherence matrix generated with the pipeline:

Example of ICN:

### What now?

The script ```ieeg_to_icn_pipeline.py``` contains all the functions for running the pipeline. Please refer to it to better understand how everything is connected and we are using the APIs from ```utils.dataproc```.
## Important note

All executable scripts, that is, scripts under the ```projects``` directory, are intended to be run from root directory position: the root folder of this repository (ieeg_to_crbs).

If you are using an IDE as PyCharm, you need to edit the ```Working directory``` configuration and set it to the root directory: ```~/ieeg_to_crbs/```.

If you are executing from a UNIX Terminal, you can set the ```PYTHONPATH``` to the root directory: ```$ PYTHONPATH=~/ieeg_to_crbs python3 projects/script.py```
